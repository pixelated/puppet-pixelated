@user_agent
Feature: Checkboxes
  As a user of Pixelated
  I want to use checkboxes to manage my emails
  So I can manage more than one email at once

  Scenario: User has a list of emails in each mailboxes that needs to be managed
    Given I have a mail in my inbox
    When I mark the first unread email as read
      And I delete the email
    When I select the tag 'trash'
    Then the deleted mail is there
    When I check all emails
      And I delete them permanently
    Then I should not see any email
