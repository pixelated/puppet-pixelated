@user_agent
Feature: compose mail, save draft and send mail
  As a user of Pixelated
  I want to save drafts
  So I can review and send them later

  Scenario: user composes and email, save the draft, later sends the draft and checks the sent message
    When I login
    When I compose a message to 'pixelated@friends.org'
    When I select the tag 'drafts'
    When I open the first mail in the mail list
     And I send it
    When I select the tag 'sent'
      And I open the first mail in the mail list
    Then I see that the subject reads 'Pixelated rocks!'
    Then I see that the body reads 'You should definitely use it. Cheers, User.'
