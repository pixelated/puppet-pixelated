@user_agent
Feature: forward and deletion
  As a user of Pixelated
  I want to forward emails using CC and Bcc features
  So I can take actions

  Scenario: User forwards a mail, add CC and BCC address, later trash the mail
    Given I have a mail in my inbox
    When I open the first mail in the 'inbox'
      And I choose to forward this mail
    When for the 'CC' field I enter 'pixelated@friends.org'
      And for the 'Bcc' field I enter 'pixelated@family.org'
      And I forward this mail
    When I open the first mail in the 'sent'
    Then I see the mail has a cc and a bcc recipient
    When I choose to trash
#    Then I see that mail under the 'trash' tag
    When I select the tag 'trash'
      And I open the first mail in the mail list
