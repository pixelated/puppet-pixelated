Feature: login and send mail


  Scenario Outline: user logs in, composes and send an email, then deletes it
    Given I login as "<user>" with password "<password>" to an organization install of pixelated
    When I send an email to myself
    Then I see the email on the mail list
    Then I delete the email
    Then I see it in the trash box
    And I delete it permanently

    Examples:
    | user  | password   |
    | alice | WuSh3ohse4 |
    | eve   | Voh0ohghai |
    | bob   | quuojoo1Su |
